## !! Project Ended !!
Due to other projects and tasks I can no longer maintain this project. This project and the server package will become archived. If you want to restart this project, or want to use (part of) the code, please contact me on Discord (Underlyingglitch#6612)

## About
WARNING!
> To use this application you need the [piscreen-server](https://github.com/Underlyingglitch/piscreen-server). This application can NOT be installed onto the same device, so use a second Raspberry Pi.`

## IMPORTANT BEFORE INSTALLATION!
1. Make sure that the server and all clients have a static ip address (local). These addresses are used to establish communication. If they change, the server will not be able to reach the clients
2. HDMI output sometimes doesn't work when connecting the HDMI cable after the Raspberry Pi was powered. Please connect all cables before powering the Raspberry Pi
